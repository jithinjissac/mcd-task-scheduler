# Date-Specific File Loading Fix

## Problem Identified
When uploading a file on the landing page for a specific selected date, the TaskScheduler wasn't properly loading employees and assignments for that exact date. This happened because:

1. **Timing Issue**: The TaskScheduler used the default `selectedDate` state (today) before processing the date from sessionStorage
2. **State Update Delay**: React state updates are asynchronous, so operations dependent on the date were using stale values
3. **Assignment Loading**: Assignments were cleared/loaded using the wrong date key

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Date Processing Order**
- Load date from sessionStorage FIRST before any date-dependent operations
- Use a `workingDate` variable for immediate operations while state updates
- Ensure all file operations use the correct selected date

### 2. **Enhanced Date-Specific Loading**
- Created `loadEmployeesFromStorageForDate(dateKey)` function for explicit date loading
- Modified initialization to pass specific date keys instead of relying on state
- Added comprehensive logging to track date operations

### 3. **Improved Assignment Loading**
- Load assignments using the correct date key from the start
- Ensure day part restoration works for the selected date
- Clear assignments for the correct date when replacing all assignments

## Code Changes

### TaskScheduler.tsx - Key Improvements

```typescript
// Before: Used selectedDate state that might be stale
const dateKey = selectedDate.toISOString().split('T')[0];

// After: Use workingDate for immediate operations
let workingDate = selectedDate; // Default to current state
const dateRaw = sessionStorage.getItem('selectedDate');
if (dateRaw) {
  const parsedDate = new Date(dateRaw);
  if (!isNaN(parsedDate.getTime())) {
    setSelectedDate(parsedDate);
    workingDate = parsedDate; // Use immediately
  }
}

// Use workingDate for all date-dependent operations
const dateKey = workingDate.toISOString().split('T')[0];
```

### New Date-Specific Functions

```typescript
const loadEmployeesFromStorageForDate = async (dateKey: string) => {
  // Load employees for specific date without relying on state
};
```

## Workflow Now Works Correctly

### 1. **Landing Page Flow**
- User selects date (e.g., September 5, 2025)
- User uploads employee file
- File is stored with key: `2025-09-05`
- Date and employees stored in sessionStorage
- User redirected to `/assignments`

### 2. **TaskScheduler Initialization**
- Loads `selectedDate` from sessionStorage FIRST: `2025-09-05`
- Uses the selected date immediately for operations
- Loads employees for `2025-09-05` (not today's date)
- Loads assignments for `2025-09-05`
- Clears old assignments for `2025-09-05` if replacing

### 3. **Data Persistence**
- All saves use the correct date key: `2025-09-05`
- Employee pool updates preserve the selected date
- Assignment changes save to the selected date
- Day part changes save to the selected date

## Testing Verification

### To Test the Fix:
1. **Go to Landing Page**: http://localhost:3001
2. **Select Future Date**: Choose any date other than today (e.g., September 10, 2025)
3. **Upload Employee File**: Upload a CSV/XLSX file
4. **Verify in TaskScheduler**: 
   - Check that the date picker shows your selected date
   - Verify employees loaded for that specific date
   - Make assignments and save
   - Return to landing page and select the same date again
   - Confirm data persists for that specific date

### Console Logs to Watch:
- `Loading employees for date: 9/10/2025 DateKey: 2025-09-10`
- `Replace all assignments: clearing existing assignments for date: 9/10/2025`
- `Assignments loaded from storage for specific date: 2025-09-10`

## Benefits

âœ… **Date Accuracy**: Files load for the exact date selected on landing page
âœ… **Data Isolation**: Each date maintains separate employee pools and assignments  
âœ… **Workflow Consistency**: Landing page â†’ TaskScheduler flow works seamlessly
âœ… **Multi-Date Support**: Users can work on schedules for different dates
âœ… **Data Integrity**: No cross-contamination between date-specific schedules

The date synchronization between landing page and task scheduler is now fully functional! ðŸ“…âœ¨
